        <h1 class="come-section">Come to Our Next Book Sale!</h1>
        <p>Our monthly sale hosts over 50,000 used books, records, videos, magazines, and more from the library's collection!</p>
        <p>We charge between $0.25 and $1 for each purchase with no sales tax.</p>
        <p>You can also purchase gift certificates and book bags for $5 each!</p>
        <p>All of the money raised here goes to the library!</p>
        <h1 class="rooms-section">Rooms</h1>
          <p>Main Room: Hosts the majority of the collection but requres you to stand in line to access. It is also where you drop off any book donations that you want to give us!</p>
          <p>Children's Room: Hosts children's books, music, videos, and toys are kept.</p>
          <p>Bargain Rooms (K6 and K7): Hosts the bargain books are held here, and on Sunday prices of all the items in the bin are halved.</p>
          <p>On Saturday, the Children's and Bargain Rooms open one hour earlier than the Main Room.</p>
        <h1 class="additional-section">Tickets</h1>
          <p>Starting at 8 AM on Saturday, you can get up to two numbered tickets to reserve your place in line to the Main Room. However, if you fail to return to the Main Room before it opens, you will lose your place in line and have to join the back of the line.</p>
        <h1 class="additional-section">Admittance Limits</h1>
          <p>Because of space limitations and concerns with health and safety, we will only allow 160 customers into the Main Room at a time.</p>
        <h1 class="additional-section">Purchase Limits</h1>
          <p>Main Room: Until noon on both days, customers may only purchase up to 12 books from the Main Room. If you want to purchase more, you will have to exit the room and rejoin the line. This limitation will continue past noon if there is still a line outside but will be lifted when it disappears.</p>
          <p>Children's Room: During the first hour of the sale on Saturday, please select no more than 12 books at a time from the Children's Room.</p>
        <h1 class="additional-section">Holding Purchases</h1>
          <p>The cashiers can hold your books until you are ready to pay if you wish.</p>
